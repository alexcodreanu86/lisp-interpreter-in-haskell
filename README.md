### Basic lisp interpreter written in Haskell

This project assumes that you have ghci installed and cabal.

To run this project in the terminal just run the command `cabal run` in the root directory of the project.

To run the specs start ghci with the main test file: `ghci test/Spec.hs`. This command will load a ghci session with the specs loaded. To run the specs type `:main` in the ghci prompt. To reload the spec files run `:r`.
